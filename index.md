#### Question1:
I think using customer transaction information to multi-classify the transaction category is interesting. We use a Large Language model such as Bert, TF-IDF, and the combination of TF-IDF and Support Vector Machine to make predictions, which is really fun. It was my first time using the Large Language model in banking customer information. 
#### Question2:
In Quarter 2, we will begin to look at the inflow dataset of the customers. In the inflow dataset, I will try to focus on using some information to estimate and predict the income of each customer. The transaction information of customers is useful, but I want to explore more factors such as transaction amount and transaction location. 
#### Question3:
Since the income is a numeric number, it may not be suitable to use a classification model like Tf-Idf or LLM. I think I will use other models and other methods to estimate the potential income of customers such as regression models.
#### Question4:
I'd like to include some statistical methods since statistical values such as median and average could help me better understand the trend of the transaction amount of one customer. I believe that some statistical inference or analysis could also be useful in estimating income.
